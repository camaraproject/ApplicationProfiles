Feature: CAMARA Application Profiles API, v0.6.0-rc.2 - Operations for Application Profiles

  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # Implementation indications:
  # * apiRoot: API root of the server URL
  #
  # Testing assets:
  # * An access token including the scopes application-profiles:create, application-profiles:read,
  #   application-profiles:update and application-profiles:delete
  # * An access token issued to a different API client, to test access to profiles it did not create
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in application-profiles.yaml.
  # The XCorrelator schema is defined in CAMARA_common.yaml (code/common/).
